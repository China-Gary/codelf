/**
  A set of media query helpers for the layout system.
  Most of the time you only need pass the min size to @viewport($min). With this rule,
  keep order of the sizes start from xs to xlg.

  1. Value of $factor in $viewport($min, $max) and $viewport-all($size):
    The $factor will be the same value as it in $breakpoint-factor.
    e.g.
    .selector {
      @include viewport(xs) {
        width: $factor * 100px; // same as xs in $breakpoint-factor
      }
    }


  2. $viewport-all($size):
    This will make the @content apply to all breakpoint size. The media query order is from xs to xlg by default.
    e.g.
    .selector {
      @include viewport-all(min) {
        width: $factor * 100px;
      }
    }
    The output will be (from xs to xlg):
    @media screen and (min-width: 512px) { .selector { width: 75px; } }
    @media screen and (min-width: 880px) { .selector { width: 100px; } }
    @media screen and (min-width: 960px) { .selector { width: 100px; } }
    @media screen and (min-width: 1360px) { .selector { width: 100px; } }
    @media screen and (min-width: 1600px) { .selector { width: 150px; } }
